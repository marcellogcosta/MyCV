## Marcello Costa

Marcello Costa has M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Communications at Electronic and Computer Engineering Department on Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA), Brazil, in 2013 and 2018, respectively. His research focuses on coding theory in aeronautics and space applications, in particular for image and media transmission. He has a B. S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of the State of Amazonas (UEA), 2004. He was with Sony Brazil working in Automatic Optical Inspection system, and he worked as researcher in space and aeronautics area with electronic satellite systems and signal processing for radar systems. His current research interests include derivations for joint source-channel coding on multiresolution sources and digital communicions algorithms development.

## Professional Achievements
